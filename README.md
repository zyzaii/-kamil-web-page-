    <div id="letter">
        <p>No one ever thought or predicted that we would somehow meet each other. Especially, no one ever predicted that you would become someone so dear to me. Even you, who always seemed aloof when uncomfortable, became a carefree person around someone who made you feel comfortable. I'm so glad that I belong to those people who have witnessed that side of your personality.</p>

        <p>At first, I didn't really know how to approach you in a way that wouldn't make you feel overwhelmed. I want you to feel at ease whenever you are with me, and that's why I'm trying to get to know you more and more. From the very beginning, I knew it would be hard to make a new friend again, a friend who feels like home. I'm afraid that if I try again, the same scenario from my past trauma will occur. Even with those other friends I’ve interacted with, I didn't feel the urge to take a risk for them in order to have someone I can call my home friend, my safe place when the world and everyone around me make me feel like giving up.</p>

        <p>I don't know how to explain it, but you have really changed me positively. You have always been that friend for whom I am willing to do anything just to see you happy. You have always been that friend to whom I unconsciously give my all in every way I know. You make me feel special, heard, seen, and understood. I didn't know that this day would come when I would risk anything just to make someone feel happy, loved, appreciated, and irreplaceable.</p>

        <p>You know the current me and my past self. However, I want to make a request to you. Can you please not give up on me, even if the future me unconsciously hurts you? I know this request is full of selfishness, but I want you to be permanent in my life. I will do everything I can to work out every toxic trait of mine so that we can both grow without hurting each other. I will do anything to change my toxic or bad traits in order to keep you.</p>

        <p>Camille, I didn't know that this time I would do something like this again. Making an effort for someone without worrying that I might get invalidated or take advantage at the end. I want you to know that, by your side, I'm at ease; with your presence, I'm at peace; and with you, Camille, I'm healed. I thought healing and resting required a lot of time and too many obstacles to obtain. But now I realize that healing and resting are what I'm unconsciously doing whenever I am talking to you—bonding with you, having your presence around me, having your love within me. I didn't know that my own definition of healing and resting would be a person named Alexa Elvie Camille. You found me, Camille; you found Zairel, who is always wandering around, asking herself if she is on the right path. I've been constantly losing track, but all this time I didn't know that my lost and found would be you. I realized that I thought I was lost, but actually I'm on the right track towards you. I'm thankful that you are here, and I am thankful that I can now risk anything for someone who's named Camille.</p>

        <p>And I'm willing to do anything just for you—for your sake, for your safety, for your well-being. If you lose your track, don't worry, you have me. You may be wandering around, but you won't be alone. I am always here, ready to be lost with you, ready to figure out the right path with you. I will always be here, ready to be your home in this world full of sh*t. I will always be the Zai who will do anything just for their pababy kamil. I will always be your support system and your strength. Whenever you feel down, I'm always here, trying to find a solution to make you feel happy. Don't be afraid to face your problems because I am always here, coming up with a lot of different solutions, to be with you while you are figuring out what to do. I am always here, willing to prove that a friend is not just a word; rather, it is a person named Zairel.</p>

        <p>Sincerely yours,<br>Zyzaii</p>
